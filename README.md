# face-recognition
A face recognition system that can detect and identify faces in real-time using computer vision and deep learning techniques. It includes additional features like email notifications and voice feedback, making it suitable for security monitoring.
This is a Face Recognition Model that will recognize the images we give in the dataset by live detecting that person via camera .
If it finds the person who is in the given dataset then it will greet them as an audio by saying "Hello person_name,Welcome home".
Or if it finds the person who is not present in the given dataset then it will send the photo of that unrecognized person who is not present in the given dataset as an email to the owner of the house with accurate date and time.
So that the house owner can come to know that an unrecognized person has enter his home by the email message .
The dataset can be the family members of the house .
Here , I have used my family dataset for this Face Recognition Model .
